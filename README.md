PURCHASE ESTIMATION

The Purchase Estimation project is an interesting data analysis project that can be tackled using various machine learning algorithms. In this project, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the likelihood of a customer making a purchase. 

Two popular machine learning algorithms that can be used to tackle this problem are Random Forest Classification and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In conclusion, the "Purchase Estimation" project is an interesting and challenging data analysis project that can be tackled using various machine learning algorithms. Random Forest Classification and Support Vector Machine are two popular algorithms that can be used to develop a predictive model for this project.
